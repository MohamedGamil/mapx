---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Detailed MCP Guide** — Created `.agents/rules/instructions.md` containing a comprehensive usage guide for MapX MCP server tools, schemas, query parameters, and best practices.
- **LLM Exporter File Summaries** — Integrated heuristic summaries (class/method/function counts and dominant symbol types) for file nodes in the `llm` export format.

### Changed

- **Search Wildcard & Case-Insensitivity** — Modified the symbol search command and MCP tool to support wildcard `*` and empty string `""` queries to list all symbols under a file path constraint. Standardized `kind` search filters to run case-insensitively.
- **Logical Cluster Grouping Boost** — Refined the `mapx_context` token-budget relevance scoring heuristics to give an extra boost (+150 points) to files sharing logical clusters with the matched seed files.
- **Centralized try/catch-Aware Impact Analysis** — Extracted and centralized BFS traversal and risk categorization logic to a new reusable `ImpactAnalyzer` module. Categorized callers at depth 2+ as `MEDIUM` or `LOW` risk, and calling sites inside test files or wrapped in try/catch blocks as `LOW` risk.

- **Graph Resolution Blacklist** — Prevented standard built-in JavaScript/TypeScript globals (`Date`, `Error`, `Map`, `Set`, `Promise`, `Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Function`, `RegExp`, `Symbol`, `JSON`, `Math`, `console`, `Console`, etc.) from incorrectly resolving to user-defined symbols during database reference resolution.
- **Import Caller Filtering** — Excluded named imports and require declarations (`import` and `require` edge types) from the standard `callers` query outputs, eliminating `<top-level>` import statement noise in call graphs.
- **Enhanced Change Impact Risk Scoring** — Upgraded `mapx impact` and `mapx_impact` risk grading. Calls from test files (`.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`, etc.) are now classified as `LOW` risk, calls wrapped inside `try`/`catch` blocks are downgraded by one risk level, and callers at depth 2+ or inside test modules are classified as `MEDIUM` or `LOW` risk.
- **Filesystem Staleness Detection** — Added file modification time checking to output a staleness warning header (`⚠️ Warning: Graph index may be stale...`) in all CLI and MCP query tools when modifications occur on disk without running `mapx update`.
- **NestJS Decorator Routing** — Implemented decorator-based route extraction from class-level `@Controller` and method-level route handler decorators (`@Get`, `@Post`, `@Patch`, `@Delete`, etc.) supporting both string arguments (including template literals) and object configurations (e.g. `@Controller({ path: 'prefix' })`).

- **NestJS GraphQL & WebSockets Integration** — Added resolver extraction from `@Resolver`, `@Query`, `@Mutation`, and `@Subscription` decorators, WebSocket event subscriptions from `@SubscribeMessage`, and microservice handlers from `@MessagePattern` and `@EventPattern` using a robust, comment-resilient method name discovery helper.
- **NestJS Lifecycle & Custom Interfaces** — Cataloged class definitions implementing custom interfaces such as lifecycle hooks (`OnModuleInit`, `OnApplicationBootstrap`, etc.) and guard/pipe/interceptor definitions (`CanActivate`, `PipeTransform`, `NestInterceptor`) as queryable hooks.
- **NestJS Constructor Dependency Injection** — Extended TS/TSX tree-sitter references queries to capture type annotations in constructor parameters (e.g. `constructor(private readonly service: Service)`) and map them as `param_type` dependency injection edges in the graph.
- **AST-Based Parser Scope Resolution** — Fixed a critical scoping bug in the generic WASM parser that caused method/property symbols to incorrectly inherit the scope of the last-parsed class in file iteration, resolving them via AST ancestor symbol lookup instead.
- **JSX Rendering Edges** — Added parsing and extraction of opening (`<Component>`) and self-closing (`<Component />`) JSX tags in `.tsx` and `.jsx` files as `render` edges.
- **Native HTML Elements Filtering** — Implemented target name checking (`/^[A-Z]/`) to filter out native lowercase HTML tags (like `<div />`, `<span />`) and only emit edges for custom React component tags.
- **TS/TSX Query Separation** — Separated references query configuration between standard TypeScript and TSX files (`references.scm` and `references-tsx.scm`) to prevent grammar syntax compilation errors in non-JSX files.
- **JSX Extension Mapping** — Added `.jsx` file extension mapping to the JavaScript language registry for JSX file recognition and parsing.
- **Exporter Rendering Edge Styling** — Added distinctive cyan styling (dotted/dashed) for `render` edges in both DOT and SVG exporter modules.
- **CLI & MCP Sinks Filtering** — Added support for `render` type edges in data-bearing edges arrays in CLI and MCP server tools to ensure accurate terminal consumer/sink detection.
- **React & TSX Parser Fixes** — Added support for scanning, indexing, and querying TSX files (`.tsx` extensions) using a dedicated TSX tree-sitter parser grammar.
- **Default and Anonymous Export Parsing** — Enhanced TypeScript and JavaScript symbol extraction to query and match default class/function exports and anonymous arrow functions exported as default.
- **Anonymous Default Export Auto-naming** — Implemented auto-naming logic in the generic WASM parser to resolve anonymous default exports using the file's base name (e.g., `export default () => {}` in `Home.tsx` is named `Home`).
- **Duplicate Symbol Node Filtering** — Added a `seenNodeIds` lookup constraint during AST parse collection to prevent duplicate symbols from being extracted when matching multiple query patterns on the same node.
- **TSX Import Path Resolution** — Updated the path resolution algorithm to recognize `/index.tsx` and `.tsx` candidate targets for relative and absolute imports.
- **Exclusion Configuration Adjustments** — Extended JS/TS default ignore patterns in the configuration class to automatically exclude `**/*.test.tsx` and `**/*.spec.tsx` files.

---

## [0.2.7] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Silence prebuild-install Deprecation Warning** — Resolved the NPM deprecation warning for `prebuild-install` (transitive dependency of `better-sqlite3`) by adding a package-level override pointing directly to the tagged GitHub repository release. This preserves SQLite query/transaction integrity and prevents terminal noise during installation.
- **Fix Bun SQLite Require Compilation Warning** — Replaced direct Node-style `require('bun:sqlite')` with dynamically constructed `createRequire` in `src/core/store-bun.ts`. This silences the compiler warning during ESM builds while preserving native Bun SQLite loader capability.
- **Automatic Database Parent Directory Creation** — Updated the `Store` class constructor to check for and recursively create the target database's parent directory if it does not exist (excluding `:memory:` paths). This prevents `TypeError` crashes when programmatically instantiating the database store in new/nested directory structures.
- **ESM-Only Programmatic Usage Documentation** — Added an alert to the programmatic usage section of `README.md` clarifying that MapX is ESM-only and requires consumer applications to declare `"type": "module"` in their `package.json` to avoid resolution crashes.

---

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Interactive CLI Revamp with Clack** — Integrated `@clack/prompts` to replace old readline-based console prompts with beautiful, interactive terminal widgets. Revamped confirmation prompts, LLM tool multi-select setups (`selectProvidersInteractive`), and converted the text-based scanner progress rendering to premium animated spinner sequences.
- **Default Exclude Patterns Expansion** — Significantly expanded the default file exclusion patterns in `src/core/config.ts` to automatically ignore build directories (`dist`, `build`, `.next`), virtual environments (`.venv`, `__pycache__`), package lockfiles (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `poetry.lock`, `go.sum`, etc.), package manifests, system/log files (`DS_Store`, `*.log`), and large third-party assets (Monaco editor files, Bootstrap scripts, React/Vue production builds). This drastically reduces token consumption and database size during scans by default.
- **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md Updates** — Updated the checklist to verify NPM dependency lock synchronization via `make version-sync`, local prebuilt packaging builds (e.g. `make package-linux`), and agentic integration rules (`.agents/rules/mapx.md`). Included testing guidelines for both native CLI running and zero-installation `npx` calls.


---

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Version Sync Lock Automation** — Updated the `version-sync` target in the `Makefile` to automatically run `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`. This guarantees that `package-lock.json` is updated and synchronized instantly with new version bumps.
- **README Layout Refinements** — Re-ordered the Installation headers in `README.md` to feature global NPM installation and Zero-Installation (via `npx`) prominently at the top. Clarified the project description by noting MapXGraph is also referred to as MapX.

---

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Scoped Package Installation Instructions** — Updated global installation documentation to use the scoped package name `@mgamil/mapx`.
- **Zero-Installation via npx** — Documented instant usage and server configuration templates using `npx @mgamil/mapx` across `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, and `docs/mcp-integration.md`.
- **Tracked `package-lock.json`** — Removed `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` to ensure it is committed to the repository. This fixes missing lockfile failures in GitHub Actions setup caching and `npm ci`.

### Changed

- **Peer Dependency Compatibility** — Appended `--legacy-peer-deps` to installation commands in `Makefile` and `publish-npm.yml` workflow to automatically bypass upstream peer dependency conflicts.

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Vue parser delegation support** — Added a custom `VueParser` that extracts `<script>` and `<script setup>` blocks and delegates parsing to the `TypeScriptParser`, which allows fully extracting symbols and references inside Vue 2 and Vue 3 Single File Components (SFCs).
- **Import resolution for Vue** — Enhanced `resolveImportPath` to support `.vue` and `/index.vue` candidates, enabling correct resolution of implicit and explicit imports of Vue components.
- **Line number offsetting** — Remapped all symbol and reference line numbers within Vue files relative to their original SFC offsets.
- **`@/` alias resolution in Vue components** — Added support for `import "@/..."` target paths pointing to the `src/` directory within Vue Single File Components (SFCs).
- **Force scan option (`--force`)** — Added a `--force` option to the `scan` command to bypass the incremental parse caching and force re-parsing of all files (useful when parser or import resolver logic changes).
- **Web Dashboard UI integration** — Bundled and served compiled Web Dashboard UI assets directly from packaged native binaries. Updated local/system installation targets and the release packaging workflow to ensure the `ui` assets folder is correctly bundled and placed in share directories.
- **Programmatic ESM entry point** — Added `main`, `module`, `types`, and `exports` mapping in `package.json` to allow clean programmatic consumption of Mapx classes and helpers in external Node.js/TypeScript environments.
- **TypeScript Declarations Generation** — Configured `tsup` to generate `.d.ts` declaration files for all codebase modules, resolving import typing errors.

### Changed

- **Package Lifecycle Hook** — Moved build tasks from `prepublishOnly` to the standard `prepare` lifecycle hook to guarantee clean builds for Git installations, local packing (`npm pack`), and dry-runs.
- **NPM Publication Exclusions** — Updated `.npmignore` to ignore platform-specific local compiled binary builds (`dist/mapx-*`) to prevent accidental bulk bundling.
- **Excluded Web UI from tsup compiler** — Prevented tsup from processing browser-only Web UI client files (which contain DOM references), avoiding type-compilation errors during build.
- **CI/CD Workflow Enhancements** — Enabled dependency caching in `publish-npm.yml` to speed up builds and cleaned up scripting commands by using `npm run build:wasm`.

### Fixed

- **Type-safe Reference Resolution** — Added type-checking guards for target and symbol names inside reference resolution helpers (`resolveRequirePath`, `resolveImportPath`, `resolveSymbolToFile`) and language parser engines (PHP, generic WASM parser) to prevent crashes when encountering null, undefined, or non-string reference targets during database scans.
- **Workflow Release Security Guard** — Added strict git tag verification to the publish workflow to ensure the triggering release tag matches the declared version in `package.json`.

---

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Extended UI Metrics Dashboard** — The Web UI Metrics page is now fully aligned with the CLI `status` command, rendering detailed, harmonized cards.
  - `/api/metrics` JSON payload extended to return `totalEdges`, `verifiedEdges`, `inferredEdges`, `languages` breakdown, `symbolKinds` aggregation, `edgeTypes` aggregation, `avgEdgesPerFile`, `dbSize`, and a detailed `git` status object.
  - Metrics view updated with new dedicated cards for **Language Breakdown**, **Symbol Kinds Breakdown**, **Dependency & Edges**, and **Storage & Git Status** (complete with icons and status colors).
- **Expanded PageRank Lists** — Increased the number of returned items for Top Files (PageRank) and Top Symbols (PageRank) from 5 to 10 in both the API response and web dashboard.
- **Framework-aware ignored symbols** — Parsers now automatically skip noisy framework-specific symbols (e.g. Vue's `ref`, `computed`, `watch`, `defineComponent`, `useRouter`, `t`, etc.) when the project is detected as using that framework. This prevents low-value super-nodes from polluting the code graph, skewing PageRank, and creating noise in impact analysis
  - Centralized `IGNORED_SYMBOLS_BY_FRAMEWORK` registry in `src/parsers/ignored-symbols.ts` — keyed by `FrameworkDetector.name`, making it trivial to add ignored sets for React, Laravel, Angular, or any other framework
  - `buildIgnoredSymbols()` helper merges active framework sets into a single `Set<string>` passed once per scan pass via parser options
  - Integrates with existing `FrameworkRegistry.detectActiveFrameworks()` — no ad-hoc detection, frameworks are detected before the parsing loop using the same detector infrastructure used for routes/hooks
  - Both symbol extraction and reference/edge creation respect the ignored set, preventing orphaned inferred edges
  - Vue ecosystem coverage includes: Composition API, Vue Router, Pinia, Vue I18n (`t`, `te`, `tm`, etc.), and Nuxt/VueUse utilities
- **Makefile completeness** — Added missing targets to align with all CLI commands:
  - `sync` — Alias for `update` (incremental scan)
  - `metrics` — Show coupling/instability metrics (`make metrics [l=lang]`)
  - `edges` — Query dependency edges (`make edges [from=file] [to=file]`)
  - `lang-install` / `lang-uninstall` — Install/remove language support (`make lang-install l=ruby`)
  - `workspaces-add` / `workspaces-remove` — Register/remove repos (`make workspaces-add p=/path`)
  - `agents-update` — Update existing agent integration files
- **Cross-process Tool Call Logging in Web UI** — Persistent logging of MCP tool calls to `.mapx/tool-calls.jsonl` enables the Tool Call Log tab in the Web UI dashboard to correctly capture and display MCP tool calls even when the MCP server and Web UI are running in separate processes
  - UI server reads/serves historical logs via `/api/tool-calls` endpoint and tails new logs for real-time pushing via SSE
  - UI client renders status badges, execution durations, parameters, and error details with robust client-side deduplication
- **Dynamic Graph Node Sizing & Spacing** — Graph nodes in the Graph Explorer are now dynamically sized based on their degree (scaling from `32px` baseline up to `48px`). The layout was enhanced with dynamic `nodeRepulsion` and `idealEdgeLength` functions in `cose` layout, and scaled-up layout circles in cluster mode to give larger nodes more spacing and prevent overlap.
- **Top-Aligned Node Labels and Rendering Hierarchies** — Standard file node labels are now top-aligned with negative margins. Explicitly configured a z-index hierarchy (`z-index: 10` on nodes, `1` on edges) as a precaution so labels are always rendered on top of edges.
- **Verbose MCP Debug Mode** — Added `--debug` flag to `mapx serve` CLI command to log verbose MCP calls, including request names, arguments, duration, and completion success/error details to stderr.

### Changed

- `GenericWasmParser.parse()` now checks `options.ignoredSymbols` (a `Set<string>`) to filter symbols and references — fully data-driven, no per-parser subclass overrides needed
- Scanner's `parseFilesParallel` / `parseOnMainThread` now accept an optional `ignoredSymbols` set instead of framework-specific boolean flags
- Graph node selection in the Web UI preserves dynamic size instead of resetting to a hardcoded size.
- Improved graph interaction with optimized wheel sensitivity (`3.2`) and degree capping.
- Enhanced tool call log tailing in the UI server: added `fs.watch` for instant, near-real-time updates, and reduced fallback polling interval to 500ms for robust periodic checks.

### Fixed

- **SVG Exporter Type-Safety** — Resolved outstanding typecast compilation errors in `src/exporters/svg-exporter.ts` to make the workspace compile cleanly and remain 100% type-safe.

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **`mapx uninit` command** — Fully reverse a `mapx init`: removes `.mapx/` directory, reverts LLM agent integration files (sentinel-block cleanup in AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/mapx.mdc, etc.), removes `.mapx/` from `.gitignore`, and cleans up empty directories
  - `-f, --force` flag to skip confirmation prompt
  - Added `uninit` to package.json scripts and Makefile targets
- **Agentic MCP auto-configuration** — `mapx init` now auto-detects installed agent tools and generates MCP server config files so mapx is immediately discoverable as an MCP server with all 25 tools:
  - **opencode** → `opencode.json` (detected via `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`)
  - **Gemini CLI** → `.gemini/settings.json` (detected via `.gemini/` directory)
  - **Cursor** → `.cursor/mcp.json` (detected via `.cursor/` directory)
  - **VS Code** → `.vscode/mcp.json` (detected via `.vscode/` directory)
  - **Antigravity** → `.agents/mcp.json` + `.agents/rules/mapx.md` (detected via `.agents/` directory)
- **`mapx agents mcp` subcommand** — Manual control over MCP config generation:
  - `--detect` — Show detected agent tools without writing files
  - `--all` — Generate configs for all supported tools
  - `--tools <list>` — Target specific tools (e.g. `--tools opencode,gemini-cli`)
  - `--dry-run` — Preview actions without writing
- **Smart JSON config merging** — When a config file already exists (e.g. `.vscode/mcp.json` with other settings), mapx merges its MCP entry without overwriting existing config. On `uninit`, only the mapx entry is removed; if the file becomes empty, it is deleted entirely
- **`--no-mcp-configs` flag on `mapx init`** — Skip MCP config auto-generation if not desired
- **Antigravity provider template** (`antigravity`) — Generates `.agents/rules/mapx.md` with pre-planning initialization rules following the Antigravity `.agents/rules/` pattern:
  - Forces `mapx_sync` + `mapx_export` before any planning or reasoning
  - Pre-modification impact analysis via `mapx_impact` and `mapx_callers`
  - Post-modification re-indexing via `mapx_sync`
  - Fail-safe halt on MCP initialization errors
- **`mapx uninit` MCP cleanup** — Removes mapx entries from all MCP config files during uninit, with smart handling: deletes files that only contained mapx, or surgically removes just the mapx entry from shared configs

### Changed

- Updated `mapx agents list` to show the new `antigravity` provider (`.agents/rules/mapx.md`)
- Updated `mapx init` interactive provider selection to include `antigravity` as an option
- Updated README "Agentic Integration" section with auto-detection table and usage examples
- Updated CLI reference docs with `--no-mcp-configs`, `agents mcp` command, and Antigravity target
- Updated MCP integration docs with Antigravity configuration example
