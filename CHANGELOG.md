## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Vue parser delegation support** — Added a custom `VueParser` that extracts `<script>` and `<script setup>` blocks and delegates parsing to the `TypeScriptParser`, which allows fully extracting symbols and references inside Vue 2 and Vue 3 Single File Components (SFCs).
- **Import resolution for Vue** — Enhanced `resolveImportPath` to support `.vue` and `/index.vue` candidates, enabling correct resolution of implicit and explicit imports of Vue components.
- **Line number offsetting** — Remapped all symbol and reference line numbers within Vue files relative to their original SFC offsets.
- **`@/` alias resolution in Vue components** — Added support for `import "@/..."` target paths pointing to the `src/` directory within Vue Single File Components (SFCs).
- **Force scan option (`--force`)** — Added a `--force` option to the `scan` command to bypass the incremental parse caching and force re-parsing of all files (useful when parser or import resolver logic changes).
- **Web Dashboard UI integration** — Bundled and served compiled Web Dashboard UI assets directly from packaged native binaries. Updated local/system installation targets and the release packaging workflow to ensure the `ui` assets folder is correctly bundled and placed in share directories.

### Fixed

- **Type-safe Reference Resolution** — Added type-checking guards for target and symbol names inside reference resolution helpers (`resolveRequirePath`, `resolveImportPath`, `resolveSymbolToFile`) and language parser engines (PHP, generic WASM parser) to prevent crashes when encountering null, undefined, or non-string reference targets during database scans.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Extended UI Metrics Dashboard** — The Web UI Metrics page is now fully aligned with the CLI `status` command, rendering detailed, harmonized cards.
  - `/api/metrics` JSON payload extended to return `totalEdges`, `verifiedEdges`, `inferredEdges`, `languages` breakdown, `symbolKinds` aggregation, `edgeTypes` aggregation, `avgEdgesPerFile`, `dbSize`, and a detailed `git` status object.
  - Metrics view updated with new dedicated cards for **Language Breakdown**, **Symbol Kinds Breakdown**, **Dependency & Edges**, and **Storage & Git Status** (complete with icons and status colors).
- **Expanded PageRank Lists** — Increased the number of returned items for Top Files (PageRank) and Top Symbols (PageRank) from 5 to 10 in both the API response and web dashboard.
- **Framework-aware ignored symbols** — Parsers now automatically skip noisy framework-specific symbols (e.g. Vue's `ref`, `computed`, `watch`, `defineComponent`, `useRouter`, `t`, etc.) when the project is detected as using that framework. This prevents low-value super-nodes from polluting the code graph, skewing PageRank, and creating noise in impact analysis
  - Centralized `IGNORED_SYMBOLS_BY_FRAMEWORK` registry in `src/parsers/ignored-symbols.ts` — keyed by `FrameworkDetector.name`, making it trivial to add ignored sets for React, Laravel, Angular, or any other framework
  - `buildIgnoredSymbols()` helper merges active framework sets into a single `Set<string>` passed once per scan pass via parser options
  - Integrates with existing `FrameworkRegistry.detectActiveFrameworks()` — no ad-hoc detection, frameworks are detected before the parsing loop using the same detector infrastructure used for routes/hooks
  - Both symbol extraction and reference/edge creation respect the ignored set, preventing orphaned inferred edges
  - Vue ecosystem coverage includes: Composition API, Vue Router, Pinia, Vue I18n (`t`, `te`, `tm`, etc.), and Nuxt/VueUse utilities
- **Makefile completeness** — Added missing targets to align with all CLI commands:
  - `sync` — Alias for `update` (incremental scan)
  - `metrics` — Show coupling/instability metrics (`make metrics [l=lang]`)
  - `edges` — Query dependency edges (`make edges [from=file] [to=file]`)
  - `lang-install` / `lang-uninstall` — Install/remove language support (`make lang-install l=ruby`)
  - `workspaces-add` / `workspaces-remove` — Register/remove repos (`make workspaces-add p=/path`)
  - `agents-update` — Update existing agent integration files
- **Cross-process Tool Call Logging in Web UI** — Persistent logging of MCP tool calls to `.mapx/tool-calls.jsonl` enables the Tool Call Log tab in the Web UI dashboard to correctly capture and display MCP tool calls even when the MCP server and Web UI are running in separate processes
  - UI server reads/serves historical logs via `/api/tool-calls` endpoint and tails new logs for real-time pushing via SSE
  - UI client renders status badges, execution durations, parameters, and error details with robust client-side deduplication
- **Dynamic Graph Node Sizing & Spacing** — Graph nodes in the Graph Explorer are now dynamically sized based on their degree (scaling from `32px` baseline up to `48px`). The layout was enhanced with dynamic `nodeRepulsion` and `idealEdgeLength` functions in `cose` layout, and scaled-up layout circles in cluster mode to give larger nodes more spacing and prevent overlap.
- **Top-Aligned Node Labels and Rendering Hierarchies** — Standard file node labels are now top-aligned with negative margins. Explicitly configured a z-index hierarchy (`z-index: 10` on nodes, `1` on edges) as a precaution so labels are always rendered on top of edges.
- **Verbose MCP Debug Mode** — Added `--debug` flag to `mapx serve` CLI command to log verbose MCP calls, including request names, arguments, duration, and completion success/error details to stderr.

### Changed

- `GenericWasmParser.parse()` now checks `options.ignoredSymbols` (a `Set<string>`) to filter symbols and references — fully data-driven, no per-parser subclass overrides needed
- Scanner's `parseFilesParallel` / `parseOnMainThread` now accept an optional `ignoredSymbols` set instead of framework-specific boolean flags
- Graph node selection in the Web UI preserves dynamic size instead of resetting to a hardcoded size.
- Improved graph interaction with optimized wheel sensitivity (`3.2`) and degree capping.
- Enhanced tool call log tailing in the UI server: added `fs.watch` for instant, near-real-time updates, and reduced fallback polling interval to 500ms for robust periodic checks.

### Fixed

- **SVG Exporter Type-Safety** — Resolved outstanding typecast compilation errors in `src/exporters/svg-exporter.ts` to make the workspace compile cleanly and remain 100% type-safe.

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **`mapx uninit` command** — Fully reverse a `mapx init`: removes `.mapx/` directory, reverts LLM agent integration files (sentinel-block cleanup in AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/mapx.mdc, etc.), removes `.mapx/` from `.gitignore`, and cleans up empty directories
  - `-f, --force` flag to skip confirmation prompt
  - Added `uninit` to package.json scripts and Makefile targets
- **Agentic MCP auto-configuration** — `mapx init` now auto-detects installed agent tools and generates MCP server config files so mapx is immediately discoverable as an MCP server with all 25 tools:
  - **opencode** → `opencode.json` (detected via `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`)
  - **Gemini CLI** → `.gemini/settings.json` (detected via `.gemini/` directory)
  - **Cursor** → `.cursor/mcp.json` (detected via `.cursor/` directory)
  - **VS Code** → `.vscode/mcp.json` (detected via `.vscode/` directory)
  - **Antigravity** → `.agents/mcp.json` + `.agents/rules/mapx.md` (detected via `.agents/` directory)
- **`mapx agents mcp` subcommand** — Manual control over MCP config generation:
  - `--detect` — Show detected agent tools without writing files
  - `--all` — Generate configs for all supported tools
  - `--tools <list>` — Target specific tools (e.g. `--tools opencode,gemini-cli`)
  - `--dry-run` — Preview actions without writing
- **Smart JSON config merging** — When a config file already exists (e.g. `.vscode/mcp.json` with other settings), mapx merges its MCP entry without overwriting existing config. On `uninit`, only the mapx entry is removed; if the file becomes empty, it is deleted entirely
- **`--no-mcp-configs` flag on `mapx init`** — Skip MCP config auto-generation if not desired
- **Antigravity provider template** (`antigravity`) — Generates `.agents/rules/mapx.md` with pre-planning initialization rules following the Antigravity `.agents/rules/` pattern:
  - Forces `mapx_sync` + `mapx_export` before any planning or reasoning
  - Pre-modification impact analysis via `mapx_impact` and `mapx_callers`
  - Post-modification re-indexing via `mapx_sync`
  - Fail-safe halt on MCP initialization errors
- **`mapx uninit` MCP cleanup** — Removes mapx entries from all MCP config files during uninit, with smart handling: deletes files that only contained mapx, or surgically removes just the mapx entry from shared configs

### Changed

- Updated `mapx agents list` to show the new `antigravity` provider (`.agents/rules/mapx.md`)
- Updated `mapx init` interactive provider selection to include `antigravity` as an option
- Updated README "Agentic Integration" section with auto-detection table and usage examples
- Updated CLI reference docs with `--no-mcp-configs`, `agents mcp` command, and Antigravity target
- Updated MCP integration docs with Antigravity configuration example
