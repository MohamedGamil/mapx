# Mapx — Specs & Delivery Index

This directory tracks all planned enhancements, feature specs, and delivery iterations for the mapx project. Each spec document is self-contained and describes a discrete unit of work that can be implemented and reviewed independently.

Iterations are intended to be **sequentially deliverable** but where features have no cross-dependency they can be parallelised. See each iteration doc for explicit dependency declarations.

## Process

### Adding a new feature spec

1. Assign the next `FXX` ID from the registry above.
2. Create `specs/features/FXX-<slug>.md` using the template in [features/F01-edge-verifiability.md](features/F01-edge-verifiability.md) as a guide.
3. Add a row to the **Feature Registry** table above.
4. Assign it to an iteration (existing or new).

### Adding a new iteration

1. Assign the next `IXX` ID from the iteration summary above.
2. Create `specs/iterations/IXX.md` using the template in [iterations/I01.md](iterations/I01.md) as a guide.
3. Add a row to the **Iteration Summary** table above.
4. Update [ITERATIONS.md](ITERATIONS.md) when work starts and completes.

### Updating status

- Update the **Feature Registry** and **Iteration Summary** tables in this file.
- Log all status transitions in [ITERATIONS.md](ITERATIONS.md).
- Record any significant design decisions in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Dependency Graph

```
I01 (F01: edge schema + parser)
 └── I03 depends on I01   (metrics query uses verifiability column)

I02 (F03: glob filters)   — independent, can run in parallel with I01/I04

I03 (F02 + F04: CLI/MCP)
 ├── depends on I01 for F02 (metrics needs verifiability)
 └── F04 (edge querying) is independent of I01/I02

I04 (F05 + F06 + F10: PHP fundamentals)
 ├── F05 (FQN) is independent of all existing iterations — can run in parallel with I01/I02
 ├── F06 (type hints) depends on F05 (use-import table)
 └── F10 (noise reduction) is independent of all other features

I05 (F07 + F08 + F09: Laravel structural)
 ├── depends on I04 (F05 FQN resolution required by all three)
 └── F07, F08, F09 are independent of each other within I05

I06 (F11 + F12: Laravel advanced)
 ├── depends on I05
 ├── F11 (facades) depends on F09 binding table (optional: for cross-reference)
 └── F12 (dispatch) depends on F05 FQN only; independent of F07-F09

I07 (F13: npm distribution)
 └── FULLY INDEPENDENT — no dependency on I01–I06, can be merged at any time

I08 (F14 + F15 + F16: clusters & data flow)
 ├── INDEPENDENT of I01–I07 (can be developed in parallel)
 ├── F14 (cluster detection) benefits from F05 being merged (accurate PHP namespaces)
 ├── F15 (cluster export) depends on F14 within I08
 ├── F16 (data flow) is independent of F14/F15 — can be developed in parallel with F14
 └── F16 traces are richer when F07–F12 Laravel edges are present (dispatch, route, relation)

I09 (F17: LLM agent integration files)
 └── FULLY INDEPENDENT — no dependency on any other iteration, can be merged at any time

I10 (F18: git workspace & submodule awareness)
 ├── INDEPENDENT of all other iterations
 └── Cross-repo edges are richer when I04/I05 (PHP FQN resolution) are merged
```
